pseudocode

In main:

    Create a file object for each data file
    Create an array of all file objects
    Create a 50 row, 12 column array of intergers to hold all sales data

    Loop through each file, scan, and add the data to the 2D array,
    with each row assigned to an item, and each column assigned to a month

    Ask the user which program they would like to run, and store
    the result in a variable

    Use a switch-case system:
        Case 1:
            Call the print_item function
        Case 2:
            Call the total_sales function
        Case 3:
            Call the top_overall function
        Default case:
            Print "error"

In print_item:

    Prompt the user for which item they want to print_item,
    and store the answer in a variable

    Loop through each month, and retrieve the result at
    [month][requested_item]
    Print the value

In total_sales:

    Create a file object for sales.txt

    Loop through each item
        Set a variable to store the sales of the item
        Loop through each month
            Add the value from the month to the variable
        
        Print the item number, a tab, the sum of the sales, then a new line
        to the sales.txt file

In top_overall:

    Create 2 variables, one to store the item number of the most popular item,
    and another to store the sales of that item

    Loop through each item
        Set a variable to store the sales of the item
            Loop through each month
                Add the value from the month to the variable
        
        If the total sales is greater than the value stored for the greatest sales
            Set the greatest sales variable to the current sales value
            Set the most popular item variable to the respective item

    Print out the most popular item
